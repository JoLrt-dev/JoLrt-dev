- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jordane, a junior web-developer.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in new technologies, videogames, music and cruising on my skateboard (mostly, but not only)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and many frameworks, libraries & others stuff related to it : React, Next, Express, Node.js, and also a litle bit of Redux ... I also use databases in SQL (mySQL) and noSQL (say hi to MongoDB !) ğŸ¤“
